Welcome to emi1d's documentation!
=================================
The package emi1d contains tools to forward model and invert
electromagnetic induction data (emi). The forward model solves 
the one-dimensional (1d) approximation of Maxwell's 
equations for a vertical magnetic dipole.

Emi devices are commonly used in surbsurface exploration
for engineering applications. I developed this package
to map potential subsurface anomalies in water defenses.
Examples of commercial devices that can be analyzed with
this package are:

* `DUALEM <https://dualem.com/>`_
* `GEM2 <https://geophex.com/hand-held-gem-2-ski/>`_
